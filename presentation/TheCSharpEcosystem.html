## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Ryan Monaghan. 

I'm a backend software engineer at Evry Healthcare. 

I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics from UT Dallas. 

I'm a former high school computer science teacher turned developer and have been using C# and .NET for 5 years. 

--

### Interesting facts:
- I collect fountain pens
- I've soldered my own keyboard
- I read math textbooks for fun
- I'm currently pursing a Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech

## Broad Overview of C# and .NET 


C# is a modern, open source and object-oriented programming language.

- First released in: 2000

- **Current Version of C#:** 12.0

--

.NET is an open source, managed software framework. 

- **Current Version of .NET:** 8.0

--

To get started you just need to install the .NET SDK: 

[dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

---

## Let's Get Started

.center[.small-image[![where is the code gif](./img/where-is-the-code.gif)]]

---

## In the Command Line

To get started, open up a terminal and type:

```bash
dotnet new console --name HelloWorld-Console
```

--

This creates a few things: 
- A folder for your project
- A command line project where your code will live
- A solution file, which is a group of projects and/or libraries that can make up an application

To open it in VS Code just type:

```bash
cd HelloWorld-Console
code .
```

---
name: In The Command Line

## In the Command Line

Command line applications are great for:

- Simple proof of concepts
- Testing out a new library
- Processing local data
- Creating small utility programs

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello DSD");
```

.center[.small-image[![ls command linux gif](./img/ls-command-linux.gif)]]

???

For example at work I need to massage addresses for healthcare providers so that USPS see's it as a valid address. 
I've written a commandline application that allows me to send multiple addresses from a excel document. 
This saves me from having to use their website and doing a bunch of copying and pasting 

---

## On the Web

C# and .NET are great tools for building websites and APIs. You can create:
- Web APIs
- SPAs with React, Vue and Angular
- Razor Pages
- Blazor
- Websites using the MVC design pattern

ASP.NET Core is a framework for building web applications. 

Kestrel is the name of the default web server for ASP.NET Core and is a cross platform, high performance web server.

???

Show off a minimal API example

## On the Phone

.left-col70[.NET MAUI is a cross platform UI framework that lets you write C# code to create mobile apps.

MAUI lets you build mobile apps for both Android and iOS.

MAUI allows you to use native UIKit controls and utilize Touch ID, ARKit and CoreML from iOS.

## While Playing Games

C# can be used with game engines, such as: 
- Unity
- MonoGame
- Godot
- Cryengine

Cities: Skylines, Hollow Knight and Hearthstone are a few examples of games written in C#.

## In all the things (IOT)

Using [nanoFramework](https://github.com/nanoframework) you can develop and deploy code to microcontrollers.

The nanoFramework extension for Visual Studio allows you to build and deploy your C# code straight to your microcontroller.

It also provides useful templates for working with different kinds of controller boards like STM32, ESP32, m5Stack, TI and NXP.

Their github has [sample](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/tree/main/samples) code that shows you how to access:
  - MQTT
  - Bluetooth
  - WiFi
  - GPIO Pins
  - I2C
  - SPI
  - And a lot more

## .NET Myths

1. You can only develop for it in Visual Studio and on Windows.
--

  - VS Code with the C# Dev Kit
  - Jet Brains' Rider IDE for C#

--

2. Programs written with C# can only run on Windows.
--
  
  - .NET Core, which was released in 2016, allows you to write and run C# on all major operating systems

--

3. .NET is closed source and controlled by Microsoft.
--
      
  - With the introduction of .NET Core, Microsoft made .NET open source

--

4. Azure is your only cloud option.
--

  - C# and .NET applications can run in AWS, GCP or any other VPS (virtual private server)
  - On AWS you can run C# Code in Lambda functions or use C# with AWS's CDK (Cloud Developer Kit) to define infrastructure as code and provision resources through AWS CloudFormation

## What's New in .NET and C Sharp

The feature I'm most excited by is [.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview), 
which is a collection of packages that help you build applications that are: 
- Cloud Ready
- Observable
- Distributed 

--

Out of the box Aspire provides a great developer experience with its dashboard, built-in observability via OpenTelemetry and orchestration. 

--

There are a lot of prebuilt components, such as Redis, Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and MongoDB. Creating custom components is also easy and well-documented.

--

You can deploy .NET Aspire applications via a manifest, to Kubernetes or directly to Azure.

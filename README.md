# csharp-web-to-iot-presentation

A presentation by Ryan Monaghan for the [Dallas Software Developers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dallas-software-developers-meetup/) on July 23rd, 2024.


## How to view Presentation

Open the the `presentation` folder and double click on the `TheCSharpEcosystem.html` page to open the slide in your default web browser. 

Use your mouses scroll wheel or the arrow keys to navigate the slides.

The presentation was created with Remark and more documentation can be found at [https://github.com/gnab/remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

## How to run the Code Examples

You will need to have .NET 8 Installed.  

Open the `code-examples` folder and select the project you want to open. Open the file ending in `.sln` to open it in your IDE of choice. 

I used Visual Studio, JetBrain's Rider, and VS code to create these demos.

### IOT Presentation

The board I used for the IOT presentation is Freenove ESP32-WROOM Board, with the Freenove Breakout Board. You will need to follow the directions on [https://www.nanoframework.net/](https://www.nanoframework.net/) to get the needed packages and Visual Studio Extensions. 



## Code Attribution

The demos in this presentation utilized default templates from Visual Studio and JetBrain's Rider. The IOT demo was a lightly modified sample from nanoFramework. [NanoframeWork Sample Repo](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/tree/main/samples/Blinky)
